J124 Final Project Repository documenting my analysis of Bicycle Collisions in San Francisco's Mission District from 2018-2023 
# <h1>Story Pitch 
In San Francisco, bike collisions have been a major saftey risk and problem. Each year, around 30 people die and many more are injured due to collisions and road saftey problems. For cyclists, key streets are often dangerous or hotspots for accidents and in recent years the city government has implemented changes to the street rules and bike-lane design in order protect residents. Most of this work has been through Vision Zero SF —— a road saftey policy with planned actions and education efforts to decrease collisions. 

My data analysis focused on tracking collisions in San Francisco's Mission District where Visions Zero is piloting a new design for bike-lanes. This is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods to bike in and the data showed that Valencia Street, where the new proected bike lane is being piolted, is the most common road for a collision. My investigation will be tracking the saftey of this neighborhood since 2018 and where cyclists are at risk. I will analyze common locations for collisions, established a year-by-year comparison, understand the severty of these accidents and try to understand if these efforts by San Francisco's city government are effective. 

As my story continues, I plan to build of the foundation of information and understanding my data anaylsis will give me by speaking with impacted parties. [add more]

City data: [Traffic Crashes](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Crashes-Resulting-in-Injuries/kn4t-hihx)
This is a city map of all Traffic Crashes in San Francisco which resulted injury. If I was to expand this investigation to a citywide project I would use this data to map and specify exactly where injuries occured and which neighborhoods to focus on.
